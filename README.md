# Heart Disease Patient Identification
 ## To predict heart disease based on various health metrics.
 ***The project demonstrates various aspects of building a machine learning model with TensorFlow and Keras, including data preprocessing, model building, and training. It also showcases the use of the functional API for building complex models and the use of tf.data.Dataset for efficient data batching. The model’s predictions are based on the processed input data. The project ends by printing the prediction of the first three rows.***

 ***- Originating from 1988, this Kaggle dataset encompasses four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It comprises 76 attributes, including the predicted one, but published studies typically utilize a subset of 14. The “target” field signifies the existence of heart disease in the patient, with an integer value of 0 indicating no disease and 1 indicating disease.***

 ### The Heart dataset contains the following features
 *age*
*sex*
*chest pain type (4 values)*
*resting blood pressure*
*serum cholestoral in mg/dl*
*fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl*
*resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)*
*maximum heart rate achieved*
*exercise induced angina*
*oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest*
*the slope of the peak exercise ST segment*
*number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy*
*thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect*
